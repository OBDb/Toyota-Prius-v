    description: "The Toyota Prius v (known as Prius α in Japan and Prius+ in Europe) represented the first expansion of the Prius into a family of vehicles, offering a more practical wagon-like body style with substantially increased cargo capacity and interior space compared to the standard Prius liftback. Based on a modified version of the third-generation Prius platform but with a longer, taller body, the Prius v featured a more upright, practical design prioritizing interior volume while maintaining the distinctive Prius aerodynamic profile and hybrid identity. Powered by Toyota's Hybrid Synergy Drive system combining a 1.8-liter Atkinson-cycle gasoline engine with electric motors for a combined 134 horsepower—the same powertrain as the standard Prius—the Prius v delivered an EPA-rated 42 mpg combined, lower than the standard Prius due to increased weight and less favorable aerodynamics but still exceptional for a vehicle of its size and capacity. The interior focused on family practicality with flexible seating for five (North American models) or seven (European and Japanese models), sliding and reclining rear seats, and up to 67.3 cubic feet of cargo space with rear seats folded—providing approximately 60% more cargo room than the standard Prius. Technology and features were similar to the contemporary Prius, with a central information display, available navigation, and Toyota's reputation for reliability, though with an emphasis on practical features like multiple storage compartments throughout the cabin. The Prius v successfully addressed the needs of environmentally conscious families requiring more space than the standard Prius could provide, offering a compelling alternative to small crossovers and wagons while maintaining much of the efficiency that defined the Prius nameplate. The model was discontinued in North America after the 2017 model year as consumer preferences shifted increasingly toward crossover SUVs, though it continued longer in some international markets."
